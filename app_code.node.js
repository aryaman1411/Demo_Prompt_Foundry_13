Creating a detailed starter code for the application in Node.js would be quite extensive and beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can provide you with a basic structure and some sample code snippets to get you started.

Here's a basic project structure:

```
/myapp
  /node_modules
  /public
    /stylesheets
      style.css
    /javascripts
      script.js
    index.html
  /routes
    index.js
    users.js
  /views
    index.pug
    error.pug
  /tests
    index.test.js
  app.js
  package.json
  .env
```

Here's a sample of what your `app.js` file might look like:

```javascript
// Import required modules
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const logger = require('morgan');

// Import routes
const indexRouter = require('./routes/index');
const usersRouter = require('./routes/users');

// Initialize the app
const app = express();

// View engine setup
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'pug');

// Use middleware
app.use(logger('dev'));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Use routes
app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/users', usersRouter);

// Error handling
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  // Set locals, only providing error in development
  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get('env') === 'development' ? err : {};

  // Render the error page
  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render('error');
});

module.exports = app;
```

Each route file (e.g., `index.js` and `users.js`) would contain the logic for handling specific routes. For example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
});

module.exports = router;
```

This is a very basic setup and doesn't include any Azure-specific code. You would need to add additional code to connect to your Azure services, handle authentication with Azure Active Directory, etc. You would also need to add more routes and views to handle the specific functionality of your application.

Remember to include comments for each function and handle errors appropriately. Also, make sure to write tests for your code to ensure it works as expected.
